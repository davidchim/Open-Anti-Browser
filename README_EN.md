# Open-Anti-Browser

[中文说明](./README.md)

Open-Anti-Browser is a local desktop manager for fingerprint browser profiles

It brings two publicly available fingerprint browser engines into one interface for profile creation, proxy management, extension management, browser launching, and local API automation

The interface follows an iOS-inspired style and supports light and dark mode switching

- Manual language, Accept-Language, and timezone override
- Platform selection
- CPU thread mode: auto, manual, random
- Disable selected spoofing modules
- Extra launch arguments
- Launch window size
- Startup URLs
- Per-profile global extension override

## Main Firefox options

## Usage

### 1 Create a browser profile

- Choose Chrome or Firefox
- Fill in name, group, and remark
- Select a saved proxy or use direct connection
- Adjust fingerprint settings for the selected engine
- Save and launch

### 2 Manage proxies

- Save commonly used proxies in the proxy manager
- Test connectivity before assigning them
- Assign one proxy to multiple profiles in bulk

### 3 Manage extensions

- Upload Chrome and Firefox extensions separately
- Enabled extensions load automatically for profiles using the same engine
- A single profile can disable selected global extensions

### 4 Use the local API

- Open API Access in the sidebar to view the local URL and API Key
- Open API Docs for endpoints, parameters, and examples
- The profile start endpoint returns the automation debug port as `port`

## Automation examples

### Chrome

After Chrome starts, use the returned local debug port with Patchright through CDP

### Firefox

After Firefox starts, use the returned port with RuyiPage

## Run from source

### Requirements

- Windows
- Python 3.12 or newer
- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer

### Prepare source code

```powershell
git clone git@github.com:Wtcity22/Open-Anti-Browser.git
cd Open-Anti-Browser
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Prepare browser engines

The source repository does not include large engine binaries

Before packaging, prepare these local engine directories

- `engines\chrome\chrome.exe` with the full Chromium engine directory
- `engines\firefox\firefox.exe` with the full Firefox engine directory

You can obtain the matching versions from the engine source projects listed above

### Run locally

```powershell
python .\launch_app.py
```

## Build installer

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_installer.ps1
```

The installer will be generated here

```text
dist\installer\Open-Anti-Browser-Setup.exe
```

## Notes

- The Releases page provides ready-to-install builds
- The source repository intentionally excludes engine binaries, build outputs, runtime data, and local test cache
- Frontend source code is under `frontend/src`
- Backend API entry is `backend/main.py`

## Usage boundaries

- This project is intended for local development, automation debugging, testing, and compliant research
- Do not use this project for illegal activity, unauthorized access, platform abuse, or infringement
- Users are responsible for following local laws and the rules of any platform they interact with
